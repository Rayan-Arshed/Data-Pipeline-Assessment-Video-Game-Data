# Data-Pipeline-Assessment-Video-Game-Data
This project will analyse and consider video game reviews as well as sales performance across the world, and compare the PS4's game sales against multiplatform sales. I have ended up using four data sets for this project, they are as follows:

Popular Video Games 1980 - 2023 ðŸŽ®: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/popular-video-games-1980-2023/

Video Game Sales 1978 - 2024: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jasonlreed/video-game-sales

List of best-selling PlayStation 4 video games: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drahulsingh/list-of-best-selling-ps4-games

Global Video Game Sales: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-video-game-sales

With these four data sets, I will extract them, perform exploratory data analysis, transform the data, visualize it, and attempt some feature engineering, before saving it to a MySQL Database.
